# Offer Swipe Frontend

This is a minimal React + Ionic + Vite frontend that connects to the FastAPI backend.
It uses `react-tinder-card` to provide the swipe interaction.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure the FastAPI backend is running and accessible at the same origin or
configure a proxy for API requests.
